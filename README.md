# Criterion requirement for mobility

This vocabulary extends the [Besluit-subsidies](https://data.vlaanderen.be/doc/applicatieprofiel/besluit-subsidie) Application Profile (AP) with a criterion requirement for multi modal transportation.

A local government can describe with this criterion requirement which modality (by foot, train, cargobike...) the traveller must undertake and in which time interval and location this must happen. With this description, a Mobility as a Service application can validate the journey of the user whether it is valid for the subsidy measure or not.
